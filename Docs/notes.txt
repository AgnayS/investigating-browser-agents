Rough Notes:
> We must also investigate SOTA OS automation tools if any
> also investigate patches / code for agentic browsers
> See why vision models are doing well + How was their data collected
  > can we train on our own?

W 1,2: 
 > Explore existing guides / resources, filter through the noise
 > Deep dive into the architecure, making sure we understand SOTA agents very well
 > Understand EVERYTHING that exists out there regarding os / browser automation and their general techniques
 > Dump links, create references for stuff that we can use, skim their papers and get an idea

W 3 & 4 & 5: 
 > Use the above's 1) papers 2) blogs 3) Code & understood in depth
 > Research existing + upcoming vision techniques etc, that we can incorporate

--------------------Checkpoint 1-------------
 > Comrepshsnive summary of weeks 1-5 
 > Literature Review
-----------------------------------------------

W 6,7:
  > Build out a POC + Memory System + Error handling using the techniques we learnt above
  > Open source the code, get contributors from other projects if needed

W 8,9:
 > Buffer
 > Research what benchmarking tools exist, analyze how they evaluate web agents
> Prep for presentaiton in week 9

W 10:
 > Document benchmarks + create a video demo + flesh out a paper explaining all of the above
 > Or even better, readmes in our codebase explaining how every small thing works in Q4 2025
